## Problem Statement

In India, the industrial classification of the workforce is essential to understand the distribution of the labor force across various sectors. The classification of main workers and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, by sex and by section, division, and class, has been traditionally used to understand the economic status and employment trends in the country. However, the current data on this classification is outdated and may not accurately reflect the current state of the workforce. The aim of this study is to update the information on the industrial classification of the main and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, by sex and by section, division, and class, to provide relevant and accurate data for policy making and employment planning.

## Approach

1. Merge all the CSV data files provided and create a dataframe.
2. Perform classical machine learning tasks such as Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing. Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing various core industries and grouping business categories like Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, Manufacturing, etc.

## Results

Developed a dashboard app with Streamlit using Plotly to visualize the workers' population of various industries with respect to various geographies. Analyzed some facts and figures for the business problem.

### About the Dataset

The dataset contains state-wise counts of industrial classification of main and marginal workers of males and females who work under different works like manufacturing plastic products, rubber products, chemicals, furniture, and constructions of buildings, retail, etc.
